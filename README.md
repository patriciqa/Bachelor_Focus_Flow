# Focus Flow

Our PWA Focus Flow

## Bachelor Project Summary

For our "Bachelor Project" we created a progressive web app for stressed students during their exam phase. We worked in a team of two people.
We created a High-Fidelity Prototype in Figma and a Progressive Web App. The data is stored in [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) which is a low-level API for client-side storage. The frontend was deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Focus Flow supports students in finding a balance between concentrated learning and pleasant breaks during the examination phase. The focus is primarily on the conscious perception of one's own well-being, as students usually experience the exam phase as very stressful and intense. With a timer for focused study and break times and a mood check-in, the app offers a mix of productivity and mindfulness. Among other things, the app helps students to find out under which circumstances they can study particularly well and under which less.
